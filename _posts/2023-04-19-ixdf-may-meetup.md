Well, well. We had such a great time at the April meeting, it's already time to announce the May one. Time flies when you're having fun, right? 

This May we'll partake in some good food and drink, play a bit of billiards and share some of our individual UX career journeys with each other. Come out, join us, and make some new friends. You don't have to join IxDF to be a part of the group and everyone and their plus ones are always invited.
