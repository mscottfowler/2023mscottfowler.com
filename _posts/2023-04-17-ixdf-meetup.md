### Food, Friends and Karaoke ###
    
Oh, my goodness UX peeps! What an incredible time we had at the April Meet-up! The Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF) of NW Arkansas had their monthly meeting last night and took over The Shire in downtown Rogers. We had over 20 folks from NW Arkansas area show up. J.B. Hunt showed up to represent. Fellow J.B. Hunt UXers Shauna Mauk, Pauletta Starkenberg, Rachel May, Jen Hart, and Eduardo Martinez were there along with a large contingent of Wal-Mart and Tyson folks.

The best thing about all this is how we're building honest relationships with our peers throughout NW Arkansas. I found that I have a lot in common with the people I met. I was able to relate with friends about some of my past experiences in newspapers, embroidery, and what I'm learning now.
