### Sharing UX Journeys ###
    
Mark Francis and I arrived at the <strong>[Aloft Lounge and Bar](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/rogal-aloft-rogers-bentonville/overview/) </strong> before anyone else in the group and discovered that their oven had went kaput at the very last minute. 

Broken. Out of order. Out of commission. 

We were looking forward to having a bit food; personally, I was in need of fish and chips, but alas, we were denied. Not to be totally done in, we ordered a beer instead and settled in for the meet up.

But even with the oven out of commission, Aloft Lounge and Bar did not disappoint. A large public area complete with ample couches, chairs and tables, full bar, snack bar and billiard table, there was more than enough room for all of us to spread out, be comfortable, and get to know one another better. The service was stellar.

After hanging out, ordering drinks (plus some much-needed Door Dash) and building relationships for an hour or so, several people shared their individual UX journeys and inspired the group. Those that shared included Jennifer Hart, Jenifer Paredes, Tracy Lindstrom, Alexandra Hinds, and Ryan Phillips.

One of the best aspects of our group is the wide range of diversity in practical knowledge that we share with each other. Our members are from all over NW Arkansas and our varied backgrounds range from graphic design and prepress work to seasoned UX Designers and user researchers.

If this sounds like fun or you'd like to learn more about the UX field, come out to our next monthly meeting and bring a friend. I'll be posting the details of our June meeting very soon.
