#### I do a bit of creative writing from time to time. Here's my latest attempt. This is called *Cold, Cold River*!
    
The man sat in the front porch rocker fidgeting, waiting for the woman to drown. The chair protested with loud, agonizing creaks as it listed back and forth. His boots marked time on the wooden floor like a metronome. Time seemed to stand still.

The urgent orchestra of cicadas eclipsed the woman’s frantic splashing. They shouted their late summer evening concerto for the whole world to hear. The ebb and flow of their resonance reminded him of movies like War of the Worlds. Sinister alien armies coming to infest Earth by draining the masses to a bloody pulp. No matter — out here at the cabin on the lake — no one would hear her struggle.

“Hurry up and die,” he said at last.

He scratched at his day-old stubble, a jagged fingernail snagging beard. With listless eyes, he trimmed its remains with uneven, yellowed teeth. And spat the residue into the distance. It disappeared like it never existed.

It was a simple fact. He would be here until this whole thing was over, waiting for the priest. The priest was on his way. The priest would tell him what to do next.

Straightening his leg, he reached deep into his front pocket and pulled out his pocket knife. He scrutinized the knife, turning it over in his hands, and finally unfolded the blade. For a moment, he held the knife in his left hand and considered the bad trimming job he’d executed with his teeth. He moved the blade in short strokes over the coarse end of the nail to smooth it.

After blowing away the residue, he examined his work. He said, “Not bad, not bad at all.”

The sun slipped behind the distant mountain, hidden from the world for another day. As the song of the locust heightened, he leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes. Sleep came immediately.

When the splashing stopped, he never heard it.
