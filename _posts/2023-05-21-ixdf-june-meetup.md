Hi IxDF NW Arkansas, letâ€™s meet up at [The Shire Gastropub](https://www.theshirenwa.com/), share UX design insights and resources, discuss UX problems you are facing now, or just chat.

Maybe do a little bit of karaoke this time? Maybe I'll do some Barry Manilow for everyone. "Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl." LOL.

: June 8, 6-8 pm
The Shire Gastropub in downtown Rogers, AR
