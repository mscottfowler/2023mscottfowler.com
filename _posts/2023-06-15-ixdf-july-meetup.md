Hi IxDF NW Arkansas, let’s meet up at [Black Apple](https://www.blackapplehardcider.com//) and network over some delicious cider! We’ll be talking UX, networking, and building relationships. Remember that Black Apple doesn't serve food, but there's an awesome taco stand across the street, if you want food. Come out and join us. Plus ones are always welcome.
