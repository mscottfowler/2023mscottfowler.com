### Fellowship NWA Art Ministry
    
<a href="https://www.fellowshipnwa.org/spectra/" target="_blank">Spectra NW Arkansas</a> is hosting a meeting at the Fellowship Rogers Chapel on May 1, 2023 at 6pm to show artwork created while meditating on the book of 1 Peter. We get together to present our artwork to encourage and inspire each other. 


Spectra NW Arkansas is a community of adult NWA Christian Artists-photographers, painters, graphic designers, and writers of prose and poetryâ€”all with the same goals. If you'd like to come out and see what we've created.[Visit SPECTRA NWA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fellowship+Bible+Church+of+Northwest+Arkansas/@36.2844273,-94.1358969,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87c916a168d075dd:0x416c05ccaebfeb33!8m2!3d36.284423!4d-94.133322!16s%2Fg%2F1tjxg5pq).
