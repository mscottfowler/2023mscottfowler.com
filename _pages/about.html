    <p class="intro-paragraph">A Fayetteville, Arkansas-based acrylic and watercolor artist</p>

    <p> A graduate of the Southwest University of Visual Arts, I have an Applied Science degree in 
        advertising art. His varied career has gone through several changes from newspapers 
        and graphic design to web development and now fine art.</p>
        
        <p>A native of Arkansas, I was raised in an artistic family with a mother who was also an 
            artist. He is a member of the <a href="https://artistsnwarkansas.com/artists/scott-fowler/" target="_blank">Artists of Northwest Arkansas (ANA)</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.fellowshipnwa.org/spectra" target="_blank">SPECTRA</a>, and his work 
            can often be found in the gallery at the ANA Experimental House in Rogers, AR.</p>

        <p>I also lead the NW Arkansas Chapter of the 
            <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/local-group/north-america/united-states/arkansas/nw-arkansas" target="_blank">Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF)</a>
        where UX professionals network together to advance their careers.</p>
