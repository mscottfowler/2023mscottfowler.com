<blockquote>
    “I will go in to see the king. If I must die, I must die.” <br><em>— Esther 4:16 </em>   
</blockquote>

<p>This passage of scripture speaks about the power God uses in everyday lives. 
    Esther’s example shows me patience, reliance on God, and the courage to continue 
    no matter the consequences.</p>
    
    <p>Lately, in my own life, I have wrestled with overcoming 
    my own fears. Fears of being left alone, fears of loved ones dying, or fears of just
    stepping out and doing something that makes me uncomfortable. Trusting in how the Lord feels 
    about me personally gives me the courage to do things that I never would have thought possible. 
    This painting reminds me of the kind of radical courage that I can have when I trust in the Lord.
