<blockquote>So if you are suffering in a manner that pleases God, keep on doing what is right, and trust your 
    lives to the God who created you, for he will never fail you. – 1 Peter 4:19</blockquote>

<p>In scripture we are referred to as “Oaks of Righteousness” with roots that go down deep to find Living Water. 
    I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of a tree. You can tell that no person would ever have produced 
    a concept where roots grow down into the soil and get nourishment it needs. In turn, it grows taller, wider 
    and spreads out in the sky with leaves bearing fruit. Birds and animals go to it for food, shelter, shade, 
    and protection. As stated above, these attributes apply to us. Christ exposes so much of His wisdom in the 
    creation of a tree.

<p>This painting reminds me of how life leaves its marks all over you, while Christ is the 
    soil and water that our soul grows down into. It’s easy to focus on the broken limbs, the nicks in the bark, 
    the knot, the bugs, etc. In times of plenty, in times of storm, and times of drought, the tree continues to 
    stand because Christ holds it in His hands. Just like we do.
